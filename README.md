\# JMeter Performance Test for JSONPlaceholder API



This repository contains a JMeter project for performance testing the public \[JSONPlaceholder](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/) API.



The test plan simulates a realistic user workflow:

1\.  Fetches all posts.

2\.  Selects a random post from the response (using correlation).

3\.  Fetches the comments for the selected post.



\## ‚úîÔ∏è Prerequisites



\* \[Java](https://www.java.com/) (version 8 or higher) installed.

\* \[Apache JMeter](https://jmeter.apache.org/download\_jmeter.cgi) installed.

\* (Recommended) JMeter's `bin` directory added to the system's `PATH` variable for easier execution.



\## üöÄ How to Run the Test



The test is intended to be run from the command-line interface (CLI), not from the JMeter GUI.



1\.  \*\*Clone the repository:\*\*

&nbsp;   ```bash

&nbsp;   git clone \[https://github.com/Nikolay-Chillev/jmeter-performance-project.git](https://github.com/Nikolay-Chillev/jmeter-performance-project.git)

&nbsp;   cd jmeter-performance-project

&nbsp;   ```



2\.  \*\*Run the test:\*\*

&nbsp;   Open a command-line terminal (CMD, PowerShell, bash) in the project's root directory and execute the following command:

&nbsp;   ```bash

&nbsp;   jmeter -n -t tests/jsonplaceholder\_load\_workflow.jmx -l results/results.jtl -e -o reports/html\_report

&nbsp;   ```



3\.  \*\*Customize the Load (Optional):\*\*

&nbsp;   You can override the default number of users (threads) and the ramp-up time by passing properties with the `-J` flag:

&nbsp;   ```bash

&nbsp;   # Example with 50 users ramping up over 10 seconds

&nbsp;   jmeter -n -t tests/jsonplaceholder\_load\_workflow.jmx -Jthreads=50 -Jrampup=10 -l results/results.jtl -e -o reports/html\_report

&nbsp;   ```



4\.  \*\*View the Report:\*\*

&nbsp;   Once the test is complete, open the `reports/html\_report/index.html` file in a web browser to view the full HTML dashboard report with detailed graphs and statistics.



\## üìÇ Project Structure



\* `jsonplaceholder\_load\_workflow.jmx`: The main JMeter test plan file.

\* `/reports/`: The directory where the HTML dashboard reports are generated (ignored by Git).

\* `.gitignore`: A configuration file that tells Git which files and folders to ignore.

\* `README.md`: This documentation file.
